    "There are thirteen different ranks, from Ace to King. There are four different suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, and Spades. So, to know everything about a single card you need its rank and its suit. In card games such as blackjack, where the cards are worth a certain number of points, it is also helpful to have a third variable, called value that is an integer related to a card's rank. The values of the cards are [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,10,10,10,11], respectively (meaning, the Jack, King, Queen, and 10 have a value of 10 and the Ace has a value of 11).\n",
